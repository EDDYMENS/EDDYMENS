Hi my name is Edmond Mensah,
I enjoy working with anything software, from creating it, writing about it, teaching it to selling it.

In the span of 7 years I have worked on open source software, enterprise solutions as well as worked as a sales engineer.
These days you will find me writing a lot more about tech.
